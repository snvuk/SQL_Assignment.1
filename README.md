## SQL Commands ##

In SQL (Structured Query Language), there are several types of commands that are used to manage and manipulate data stored in databases. These commands can be classified into five categories based on their functionality. These categories are:

DDL (Data Definition Language): DDL commands are used to define and manage the structure of database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and schemas. Some examples of DDL commands are CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.

DCL (Data Control Language): DCL commands are used to control access to the database and its objects. DCL commands can be used to grant or revoke privileges to users or roles. Examples of DCL commands are GRANT and REVOKE.

DQL (Data Query Language): DQL commands are used to retrieve data from the database. DQL commands are used with the SELECT statement to retrieve data from one or more tables. The SELECT statement can be used with various options and functions to filter, sort, and aggregate data.

DML (Data Manipulation Language): DML commands are used to manipulate data stored in the database. DML commands are used to insert, update, and delete data from one or more tables. Examples of DML commands are INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

TCL (Transaction Control Language): TCL commands are used to manage transactions in the database. Transactions are used to group one or more database operations into a single unit of work. TCL commands can be used to commit or roll back transactions. Examples of TCL commands are COMMIT and ROLLBACK.



### Here are some examples of commonly used SQL commands: ###

SELECT: This command is used to retrieve data from a database. It is used with the FROM keyword to specify the table to retrieve data from, and can be used with various other keywords and functions to filter, sort, and aggregate the data.

INSERT: This command is used to insert data into a table in a database. It is used with the VALUES keyword to specify the values to insert into the table.

UPDATE: This command is used to update data in a table in a database. It is used with the SET keyword to specify the new values to update in the table, and the WHERE keyword to specify which rows to update.

DELETE: This command is used to delete data from a table in a database. It is used with the FROM keyword to specify the table to delete data from, and the WHERE keyword to specify which rows to delete.

CREATE TABLE: This command is used to create a new table in a database. It is used with various keywords and options to specify the columns, data types, constraints, and other properties of the table.

These are just a few examples of the many SQL commands that are available. SQL is a powerful and widely used language for managing and manipulating data in databases, and understanding how to use SQL commands effectively is an essential skill for data analysts and data scientists.
